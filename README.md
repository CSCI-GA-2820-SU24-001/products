CSCI-GA.2820-003 DevOps and Agile Methodologies Summer 2024

## Overview

This project aims to represent the store items that customers can buy. This service will become a part of an e-commerce website.

## Automatic Setup

1. clone repository

   ```
   $ git clone git@github.com:CSCI-GA-2820-SU24-001/products.git
   $ cd products
   ```

2. choose "reopen in Docker container" in VSCode

3. run test 

   ```python
   pytest
   ```

## Manual Setup

You can also clone this repository and then copy and paste the starter code into your project repo folder on your local computer. Be careful not to copy over your own `README.md` file so be selective in what you copy.

There are 4 hidden files that you will need to copy manually if you use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer to copy files from this folder into your repo folder.

These should be copied using a bash shell as follows:

```bash
    cp .gitignore  ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .flaskenv ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .gitattributes ../<your_repo_folder>/
```

## APIs
The products service provides the following API endpoints:

| Operation                | Method | URL               |
|--------------------------|--------|-------------------|
| **List all products**    | GET    | `/products`       |
| **Create a product**     | POST   | `/products`       |
| **Read a product**       | GET    | `/products/{id}`  |
